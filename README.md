## AI Based Automatic Movie Scene Cautioning System.
In a nutshell, this project is a simple human activity recognition model. The model is trained upon [**Kinetics dataset**](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics) Dataset from DeepMind. The dataset consists of URL links to approximately 650,000 video clips that covers 700 human action classes.
