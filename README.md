## AI Based Automatic Movie Scene Cautioning System.
In a nutshell, this project is a simple human activity recognition model. The model is trained upon [**Kinetics dataset**](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics) Dataset from DeepMind. The dataset consists of URL links to approximately 650,000 video clips that covers 700 human action classes. In this project, I have focused only on certain classes.

### ðŸ›  Implementation:
In file `Movie Cautioning System.ipynb`, you will have two implementations. One is **Frame-by-Frame** processing and the other is **Batch-wise processing**.<br>
A much better system could be implemented where the caution stays on frame for instead of flickering like in this case.
